Under db for the database we want the Docker image for Postgres 10.1 and use volumes to tell Compose where the container should be located in our Docker container.

For web we're specifying how the web service will run. First Compose needs to build an image from the current directory and start up the server at 0.0.0.0:8000. We use volumes to tell Compose to store the code in our Docker container at /code/. The ports config lets us map our own port 8000 to the port 8000 in the Docker container. This is the default Django port. And finally depends_on says that we should start the db first before running our web services.

The last section volumes is because Compose has a rule that you must list named volumes in a top-level volumes key.
